# Ratings-Prediction-Project-----Flip-Robo

### Problem Statement:

We have a client who has a website where people write different reviews for technical products. Now they are adding a new feature to their website i.e. the reviewer will have to add stars (ratings) as well with the review. The rating is out 5 stars and it only has 5 options available 1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars, 4 stars and 5 stars. Now they want to predict ratings for the reviews which were written in the past and they donâ€™t have a rating. So, we have to build an application which can predict the rating by seeing the review.

### Model Building Phase

After collecting the data, you need to build a machine learning model. Before model building do all data preprocessing steps involving NLP. Try different models with different hyper parameters and select the best model.

Follow the complete life cycle of data science. Include all the steps mentioned below:

- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Building
- Model Evaluation
- Selecting the Best ML model
